Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning application that classifies emails as either spam or ham (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a supervised learning model. The application features a user-friendly web interface to allow users to input email content and receive real-time classification results.

Features

Real-Time Email Classification: Input an email and classify it as spam or ham instantly.

Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit for an intuitive and modern user experience.

Machine Learning Model: Trained on labeled email datasets to ensure high accuracy.

Custom NLP Pipeline: Includes preprocessing steps like tokenization, vectorization, and stopword removal.
